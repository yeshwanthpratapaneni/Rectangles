Description : The following project compares two rectangles and finds if there's an overlap between them if so what kind of overlap exists between them

Approach :
1. Each rectangle is given 4 points x1,y1,x2,y2 and these points denote the bottom left and top right corners of the rectangle
2. For each rectangle generate all the points that form the rectangle
3. From the generated points from both r1 and r2 we take the intersection of the points between them
4. If the intersection points is 0 this implies either there's no intersection or one rectangle completely contains the other one
5. If the intersection points size is only 2 this implies a regular intersection.
7. If the intersection points size is greater than 2 this implies a adjacent intersection and based on the intersection size
we can deduce which type of adjacent intersection exists between them

Project Setup :
1. I have used Junit and Lombok with this project. Please refer to the pom.xml

Testing steps :
1. I have written various Junit cases covering each aspect of the rectangle overlap scenario and are available under the test directory.
